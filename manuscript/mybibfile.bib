	abstract = {Two statistical approaches, weighted regression on time, discharge, and season and generalized additive models, have recently been used to evaluate water quality trends in estuaries. Both models have been used in similar contexts despite differences in statistical foundations and products. This study provided an empirical and qualitative comparison of both models using 29 years of data for two discrete time series of chlorophyll-a (chl-a) in the Patuxent River estuary. Empirical descriptions of each model were based on predictive performance against the observed data, ability to reproduce ﬂow-normalized trends with simulated data, and comparisons of performance with validation datasets. Between-model differences were apparent but minor and both models had comparable abilities to remove ﬂow effects from simulated time series. Both models similarly predicted observations for missing data with different characteristics. Trends from each model revealed distinct mainstem inﬂuences of the Chesapeake Bay with both models predicting a roughly 65\% increase in chl-a over time in the lower estuary, whereas ﬂow-normalized predictions for the upper estuary showed a more dynamic pattern, with a nearly 100\% increase in chl-a in the last 10 years. Qualitative comparisons highlighted important differences in the statistical structure, available products, and characteristics of the data and desired analysis.},

Using watershed management as an example, this study tests the effectiveness of a collection of collaboration components included in the Integrative Collaborative Governance Regime framework for achieving environmental improvement goals using the {EPA}’s watershed-based approach. Coupling survey measures of collaboration dynamics with empirical assessments of environmental performance, this research offers evidence on the importance of specific collaborative elements and provides public managers with guidance to improve performance and achieve goals. Correlation analyses revealed the importance of monetary and technical resources to watershed partnerships’ environmental performance, validating previous literary assumptions. This study also uncovered an incongruence between participants’ acceptance of assigned roles and responsibilities within the watershed partnership and achievement of watershed improvement goals. This suggests that it is not enough to get the right people to the table—they must also be assigned the right roles. {DOI}: 10.1061/({ASCE}){WR}.1943-5452.0000802. © 2017 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	abstract = {With the widespread use of collaborative governance mechanisms for mitigating water pollution, an opportunity exists to test alternative institutional designs based on collaborative governance theory using computer simulation models, particularly when there is a clear relationship between governance networks, observable resource allocation decisions, and measurable outcomes.This is especially the case for wicked problems like nonpoint source water pollution where there are compelling questions regarding how best to design policies, allocate funds, and build administrative capacity to meet water quality standards. We present an agent-based model ({ABM}) of water governance for the Lake Champlain Basin to simulate the impacts of alternative collaborative governance arrangements on the development of suites of water quality projects. The {ABM} is connected or coupled with land use and phosphorus load accumulation models that are informed by existing hydrologic models, project datasets, and state-set load reduction targets. We find that regionally arranged collaborative governance in water quality project planning and implementation can lead to better water quality outcomes, thereby affirming one of the central premises of collaborative governance regime theory. We also find that externally mandated collaboration, as opposed to voluntary, self-initiated collaboration, can lead to better water quality outcomes, adding to our understanding of which type of collaborative governance arrangement is best suited to the specific contexts of this case. Further, without adequate administrative capacity in the form of human resources located in central network actors to manage project funds, “administrative bottlenecks” may form and money can go unspent. This research demonstrates the efficacy of using simulations of alternative institutional design for theory testing and tuning, and policy prototyping.},

This study sampled creeks representing forested, suburban, and urban watersheds along a longitudinal gradient for indicators of water quality, including traditional indicator bacteria (fecal coliforms and enterococci) and alternative viral indicators (male-speciﬁc and somatic coliphages). Tested microorganisms were generally distributed with highest concentrations in creek headwaters and in more developed watersheds. The headwaters also showed the strongest predictive relationship between indicator concentrations and urbanization as measured by impervious cover. A seasonal pattern was observed for indicator bacteria but not for indicator viruses. Coliphage typing indicated the likely source of contamination was nonhuman. Results suggest that headwater creeks can serve as sentinel habitat, signaling early warning of public health concerns from land-based anthropogenic activities.

Microbial source tracking ({MST}) results had identiﬁed Escherichia coli (E. coli) contributors to the waterbody as human and unidentiﬁed (10\%), cattle and domestic animals (25\%), and wildlife (65\%) in a rural watershed. The illness risks associated with ingestion during recreation were calculated by assigning reference pathogens for each contributing source and using pathogen dose–response relationships. The risk of {GI} illness was calculated for a speciﬁc sampling site with a geometric mean of E. coli of 163 colony forming units (cfu) 100 {mL}−1, and the recreational standard of E. coli, 126 cfu 100 {mL}−1. While the most frequent sources of fecal indicator bacteria at the sampling site were nonhuman, the risk of illness from norovirus, the reference pathogen representing human waste, contributed the greatest risk to human health. This study serves as a preliminary review regarding the potential for incorporating results from library-dependent {MST} to inform a {QMRA} for recreational waters. The simulations indicated that identifying the sources contributing to the bacterial impairment is critical to estimate the human health risk associated with recreation in a waterbody.},

Quantitative Microbial Source Tracking ({MST}) was employed from 2012 to 2015 to inventory sources of natural and anthropogenic fecal indicator bacteria ({FIB}). Data suggested {FIB} exceedances could be traced to gulls based on gull marker prevalence and correlations with {FIB} concentrations in seawater, sand, and eelgrass. In contrast, human marker concentrations and a tracer dye test did not indicate prevalent human sources. Exponential decay of gull marker in sand amended with live Catellicoccus marimammalium suggested that measured marker reﬂected fecal inputs versus growth outside the host. Improved water quality was coincident with a 2013 bird exclusion structure, consistent with {NSE}. However, load allocation needed for {TMDL} reconsideration was hampered by variable ratios of {FIB}, {MST} markers, and pathogens measured in seawater and in gull, cat, and raccoon feces. Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment is a suggested path forward because such models can incorporate distributions from a combination of {FIB} sources and communicate criteria in terms of human health risk.},

	abstract = {For many freshwater systems, mitigating agricultural runoff of nutrients is a key requirement for curbing eutrophication and reducing subsequent ecological threats. However, defining the best way to achieve reductions in agricultural runoff can be a contentious issue. A policy debate is currently unfolding in Ohio focused on whether the state government should introduce regulatory policies on agriculture to reduce nutrient loadings from watersheds in an attempt to also reduce harmful algal blooms in Lake Erie. To inform policy development, we used a survey instrument to gauge public acceptance of regulatory policies and examined the psychological determinants of Ohio residents’ support for a regulatory policy proposal that would introduce fines on excessive agricultural runoff. We designed a survey instrument with nine predictors of people’s willingness to support regulations: 1) effectiveness of voluntary programs, 2) risk perception, 3) water quality perception, 4) trust in farmers, 5) trust in state government, 6) belief about fertilizer runoff as a major cause of {HABs}, 7) belief that farmers alone should not bear the burden to restore water quality in Lake Erie, 8) belief that regulation is necessary to keep farmers accountable, and 9) belief that regulation harms economy and employment. We also measured variables that represented different levels of self-interests, awareness of reduction goals, political party affiliation, and demographic characteristics. We collected a sample of 1000 respondents, who were representative of Ohio residents by age, gender, race, and education level. Most predictors were significant and in the directions hypothesized, with exception of water quality perception and belief about regulation and jobs. One’s a priori belief that regulations are necessary to keep farmers accountable for their land management practices had the largest enhancing effect for accepting a regulatory policy of fines, while trust for farmers had the largest inhibiting effect. In comparison, water quality perception was not significant in predicting individual policy attitudes. This study informs the public engagement and communication efforts and suggest directions for future research on public policy support.},

This is often referred to as microbial source tracking. However, recent studies have reported that E. coli can become “naturalized” to soil, sand, sediments, and algae in tropical, subtropical, and temperate environments. This phenomenon raises issues concerning the continued use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination. In this review, we discuss the relationship between E. coli and fecal pollution and the use of this bacterium as an indicator of fecal contamination in freshwater systems. We also discuss recent studies showing that E. coli can become an active member of natural microbial communities in the environment, and how this bacterium is being used for microbial source tracking.

Health protection, as indexed by {FIO} control, is a central aim of new ‘catchment-scale’ water quality management required in the {USA} by the Clean Water Act and in the European Union ({EU}) by the Water Framework Directive ({WFD}). Experience of the former, after a decade of implementation, suggests that the most signiﬁcant reason for water quality ‘impairment’ is elevated {FIO} concentrations, mainly in recreational and shellﬁsh harvesting waters. This provides an early warning of possible problems which the {EU} regulatory authorities are likely to face. To date, however, a surprising lack of {EU} attention has been given to prediction and control of catchment ﬂuxes of this key parameter. This is likely to prove embarrassing if the experience of the {US} regulatory community is not acted upon with some urgency. There is a growing, though still partial, body of empirical science to form the ‘evidence-base’ for good regulatory practice. However, adoption of ‘best management practices’ ({BMPs}) to effect remediation of impacted waters will require close integration of water policy with policies on ﬁnancial support for the farming community. This is likely to require enhanced communication and integration within the discrete policy communities addressing the agricultural sector through the Common Agricultural Policy and water regulation through the Water Framework Directive.},

	abstract = {Collaborative approaches are increasingly used to address challenging environmental problems in the United States and around the world. The inclusion of multiple stakeholders and sources of information is expected to solve such problems. Prior research has highlighted the importance of collaborative process characteristics in reaching agreements and building social capital, but less is known about what factors affect the implementation of such agreements. A parallel stream of research in policy implementation theory has developed variables and frameworks to explain the implementation of authoritative policy prescriptions. Drawing on the top-down/bottom-up perspectives on implementation, this study examines implementation of collaborative recommendations along a continuum of top-down/ bottom-up approaches. A comparison of six cases in two states (Lower Saxony, Germany and Ohio, United States) indicates important differences in perceptions of implementation and environmental improvements, although whether an effort was more top down or more bottom up was not a key determinant of results. In both states, stakeholder collaborative planning efforts included substantial involvement from stakeholders and multiple government agencies and levels. Participants in the Ohio cases perceived higher levels of implementation and environmental improvements. Key factors promoting implementation of plan recommendations were resources (funding and a full-time coordinator), willing land owners, and networks. In the Lower Saxony cases, collaborative plans were seen as less impactful, but nevertheless the process of plan development did foster networks for implementing some actions to improve water quality.},

Model development included selecting a {GAM} structure to describe nonlinear seasonally-varying changes over time, incorporating hydrologic variability via either river flow or salinity, and using interventions to model method or laboratory changes suspected to impact data. This approach, transferable to other systems, allows for evaluation of water quality data in a statistically rigorous way, while being suitable for application to many sites and variables. This enables consistent generation of annual updates, while providing a tool for developing insights to a range of management- and researchfocused questions.},

	abstract = {Changes in water temperature can have important consequences for aquatic ecosystems, with some species being sensitive even to small shifts in temperature during some or all of their life cycle. While many studies report increasing regional and global air temperatures, evidence of changes in river water temperature has, thus far, been site speciﬁc and often from sites heavily inﬂuenced by human activities that themselves could lead to warming. Here we present a tiered assessment of changing river water temperature covering England and Wales with data from 2773 locations. We use novel statistical approaches to detect trends in irregularly sampled spot measurements taken between 1990 and 2006. During this 17-year period, on average, mean water temperature increased by 0.03 °C per year (±0.002 °C), and positive changes in water temperature were observed at 2385 (86\%) sites. Examination of catchments where there has been limited human inﬂuence on hydrological response shows that changes in river ﬂow have had little inﬂuence on these water temperature trends. In the absence of other systematic inﬂuences on water temperature, it is inferred that anthropogenically driven climate change is driving some of this trend in water temperature. © 2014 The Authors.

	abstract = {This research examines the relationship of Escherichia coli concentrations to stream order and watershed size and considers the implications on water quality standards. To assess geospatial effects, E. coli data were obtained from 743 monitoring stations in the Central Great Plains, Cross Timbers, and South Central Plains ecoregions of Texas and Oklahoma. Median and geometric mean E. coli concentrations were analyzed for correlation with stream order and watershed size at each site. Comparison of the three ecoregions revealed E. coli concentrations were highest in the westernmost Central Great Plains and lowest in the easternmost South Central Plains. Similarly, the strength of E. coli’s correlation with stream order and watershed area decreased with ecoregion moving west to east. Thus, incorporating ecoregion approaches when defining stream water quality standards is supported. Analysis showed no significant relationship of stream order or watershed size to E. coli concentrations in leastimpacted watersheds (i.e., watersheds with minimal wastewater discharge and urbanization). Conversely, analysis of data from all sites showed a weak negative relationship between E. coli concentration and stream order and watershed size, with E. coli concentration generally decreasing with increasing stream order and watershed size. However, variability in smaller watersheds and lower-order streams supports continued use of site-specific studies to determine appropriate standards. Three-parameter exponential models provided an approach to estimate E. coli concentrations using Shreve stream order and watershed area and identify outlier streams potentially affected by anthropogenic activities where further investigation or remediation may be warranted.},

An understanding of the regional and interannual variability in nitrogen loading and associated drivers is necessary for the design of eﬀective management strategies. Here we develop a parsimonious empirical model based on net anthropogenic nitrogen input, precipitation, and land use that explains 68\% of the observed variability in annual total nitrogen ﬂux ({QTN}) (76\% of ln({QTN})) across 242 catchment years. We use this model to present the ﬁrst spatially and temporally resolved estimates of {QTN} for all eight-digit hydrologic unit ({HUC}8) watersheds within the continental United States ({CONUS}), focusing on the period 1987−2007. Results reveal high spatial and temporal variability in loading, with spatial variability primarily driven by nitrogen inputs, but with interannual variability and the occurrence of extremes dominated by precipitation across over three-quarters of the {CONUS}. High interannual variability and its correlation with precipitation persist at large aggregated scales. These ﬁndings point to a fundamental challenge in managing regions with high nutrient loading, because these regions also exhibit the strongest interannual variability and because the impact of changes in management practices will be modulated by meteorological variability and climatic trends.},

Previously published Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment ({QMRA}) methods were employed and extended to meet these objectives. Health outcomes used in the analyses were infection from reference waterborne pathogens via ingestion during recreation and subsequent gastrointestinal ({GI}) illness. Illness risks from these pathogens were calculated for exposure to faecally contaminated recreational water at the U.S. regulatory limits of 35 cfu 100 {mLÀ}1 enterococci and 126 cfu 100 {mLÀ}1 Escherichia coli. The probabilities of {GI} illness were calculated using pathogen dose-response relationships from the literature and Monte Carlo simulations. Three scenarios were simulated, representing a range of feasible interpretations of the available data. The primary ﬁndings are that: 1) {GI} illness risks associated with exposure to recreational waters impacted by fresh cattle faeces may not be substantially different from waters impacted by human sources; and 2) the risks associated with exposure to recreational waters impacted by fresh gull, chicken, or pig faeces appear substantially lower than waters impacted by human sources. These results suggest that careful consideration may be needed in the future for the management of recreational waters not impacted by human sources.},

However, serial and/or cross-correlation has been ignored in ﬁeld trend-analyses. This study attempts to develop a methodology that takes into account both serial and cross-correlation in the assessment of the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends. The regional average Mann–Kendall ({RAMK}) statistic is used to represent the regional properties of trends at a regional scale. The null distribution of the {RAMK} statistic is derived on the basis that the joint probability distribution of m independent normal variables is also normally distributed. The variance of the {RAMK} statistic is then modiﬁed by serial and cross-correlation. The applicability of the method was demonstrated by applying it to assess the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends in annual mean, annual maximum, and annual minimum daily streamﬂow from 1967 to 1996 in ten major homogeneous climate regions of Canada. The results indicate that the method developed provides more accurate assessment of the ﬁeld signiﬁcance of trends than that without consideration of serial and cross-correlation.},
